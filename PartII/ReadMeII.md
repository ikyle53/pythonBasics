# Part II

## Python object types

This part of the book focuses on "Things" an "Stuff". The things are the operations (addition, concatenation). The stuff are objects in which the things are operating on.

### "Stuff" (Objects)

In Python objects are essentially just pieces of memory. These are built into python and can also be created using classes or things like C extension librares. In Python EVERYTHING is an object.

Python programs can be decomposed into modules, expressions, and objects:

1. Programs are composed of modules
2. Modules contain statements
3. Statements contain expressions
4. Expressions create and process objects

Traditional programming often stresses three different pillars~ Python has tools in all 3:

1. Sequence - Do this, then that
2. Selection - Do this if that is true
3. Repetition - Do this many times
